## Assumption of the project
I was interested in buying a laptop for programming. Unfortunately - during pandemic prices were rather high so I decided to create a script that would allow me to check if there are any discounts for the desired laptop


## Steps performed
* Fetch the content of pages from several stores offering the laptop
* Analyze gathered data to see if some price is lower than usual one
* Trigger opening of the web browser with page having the discount for the laptop

## Technologies
* Python (requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup, selenium)
